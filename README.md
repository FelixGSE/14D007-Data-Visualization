## Project description and folder content 

In my final project I created a website containing an interactive graph of the german Input-Output network (in javascript). The website is available [here](http://felixgse.github.io/14D007-Data-Visualization/ ).

The *Analysis* folder contains two R-scripts. *analysis.R* runs the centrality analysis and creates a javascript file containing a formated data set used by *index.html*. It sources *centrality_functions.R*, which initialises both centrality meassures introduced by **[Bloechl et al., 2010]** and **[Bloechl et al., 2011]**.

Data and literature stores the mentioned papers and both the data used on the website and the input-output related data used by the R-scriptes.
