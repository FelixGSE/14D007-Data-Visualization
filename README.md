# Data-Visualisation-2015

This repository stores all related files for the final project of my graduate class in data visualization. 
In the project I created a website containing an interactive graph of the german Input-Output network. The website is available [here](http://felixgse.github.io/Data-Visualisation-2015/).

The *Analysis* folder contains two R-scripts. *analysis.R* runs the centrality analysis and creates a javascript file containing a formated data set used by *index.html*. It sources *centrality_functions.R*, which initialises both centrality meassures introduced by **[Bloechl et al., 2010]** and **[Bloechl et al., 2011]**. 

Data and literature stores the mentioned papers and both the data used on the website and the input-output related data used by the R-scriptes.
